Things wrong with the code :

- The method 'public static void average(int kfc[])' doesn't compute the average of the integers or return the value.
    -   Check the return value of 'void'.

- When receiving input from the keyboard it is best not to declare variables within a looping statement (not memory efficient).
    -   Check the lines 'int num1 = input.nextInt();'

- There is a type mismatch in the last line 'System.out.printf("The average is %.2f", array[i]);'
    -   Note that array[i] is not a floating number.
    -   This seems to be main cause of your error.
